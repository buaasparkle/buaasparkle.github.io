Hello, This is the reopository of buassparke's personal blog build upon [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which could easily transform markdown plain text into static website and blogs.

This blog website uses default `minima` theme, feel free to visit my [blog](https://buaasparkle.github.io) to have a look at its style.

If you'd like to build your own blog website, [Github Page](https://pages.github.com/) and [Blogging with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) reference pages would give you much help. Clone this repo may also be helpful ðŸ¤—.

At last, I hope to keep updating this site where my programming and learning experiences will be shared with you.

Thanks.
