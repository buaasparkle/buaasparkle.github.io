You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

# Origin
There's an old Chinese saying that <cite>It is the first step that is troublesome</cite>.
This blog site kicks off in the Spring Festival 2020, where the whole contry suffering from the [2019-nCov][2019-nCov-Chinese].
I typed these words on the sofa at home, hoping to get through all the rough times, both for my contry and myself.

# Category
In this site , I'd like to introduce at least 3 series of topics about programming knowledge and skills.
- `Whats` series: introduce the fundamental concepts of what I'm interested in.
- `HowTo` series: digging into the implementation of codes, show me the f*cking source code.
- `miscellaneous` series: except the above 2 series.

# Wishes
I encourge myselft to start from this site to overcome my laziness, hope you'll enjoy the journy with me.

`More Efforts, More Fortune.`
